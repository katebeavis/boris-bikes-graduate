# Boris Bikes Graduate

This version of Boris Bikes was completed after I graduated from Makers Academy in the role of an alumni helper, to better understand how I could help and mentor the students completing it.

### BDD and OOD Basics: Boris Bikes

The goal of this project is to introduce you to:

- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
- How BDD relates to Test Driven Development (TDD)
- The process of domain modeling for Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

### Project Overview

We are going to create a simple system to support Boris Bikes in London. Our system will allow members of the public to remove and return bikes from docking stations. Occasionally the bikes may break, and then they will be unavailable for rental. There will be a garage to fix broken bikes. Finally, there will be a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage so there are working bikes for members of the public to use.
